          I'm a passionate and driven junior full-stack software engineer with a foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. My journey into tech began at Moringa School, where I discovered my love for building clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications. I'm particularly enthusiastic about working with React and Python, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and expand my skillset.

          I thrive on problem-solving and enjoy the challenge of turning complex ideas into reality. My curiosity and fast-learning abilities allow me to adapt quickly to new environments and contribute effectively to any team.
